# PyDBMS
PyDBMS is a fun project that creates a database management system from scratch, utilizing only built-in Python libraries &amp; code.

The goal is to mimic all traditional database functionality using 100% Python code.

Very much a work in progress, but a fun work in progress nonetheless.

Current Functionality:
- Tokenization of user queries
- (Rough) SQL implementation
- Database & Table Creation
- (Rough) Login / authentication / account management system

Future Functionality:

Database
- Locking mechanisms
- Rollback mechanisms

Table
- Additional SQL Query functionality: Update, Drop, insert, view, etc.
